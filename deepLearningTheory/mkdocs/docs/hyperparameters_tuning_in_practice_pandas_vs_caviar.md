| Babysitting | So, for example, on Day 0 you might initialize your parameter as random and then start training. And you gradually watch your learning curve, maybe the cost function J or your dataset error or something else, gradually decrease over the first day. Then at the end of day one, you might say, gee, looks it's learning quite well, I'm going to try increasing the learning rate a little bit and see how it does. And then maybe it does better. And then that's your Day 2 performance. And after two days you say, okay, it's still doing quite well. Maybe I'll fill the momentum term a bit or decrease the learning variable a bit now, and then you're now into Day 3. And every day you kind of look at it and try nudging up and down your parameters. And maybe on one day you found your learning rate was too big. So you might go back to the previous day's model, and so on. |
| Models in parallel | The other approach would be if you train many models in parallel. So you might have some setting of the hyperparameters and just let it run by itself ,either for a day or even for multiple days, and then you get some learning curve like that; and this could be a plot of the cost function J or cost of your training error or cost of your dataset error, but some metric in your tracking. And then at the same time you might start up a different model with a different setting of the hyperparameters. And so, your second model might generate a different learning curve, maybe one that looks like that. |
