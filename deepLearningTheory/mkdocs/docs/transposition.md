# Transposition

The transpose of an m-by-n matrix A is the n-by-m matrix $A^{T}$ (also denoted $A^{tr}$ or $^{t}A)$ formed by turning rows into columns and vice versa:
$(A^{T})i,j = Aj,i$


$${\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\0&-6&7\end{bmatrix}}^{\mathrm {T} }={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\2&-6\\3&7\end{bmatrix}}} $$


Familiar properties of numbers extend to these operations of matrices: for example, addition is commutative, that is, the matrix sum does not depend on the order of the summands:

A + B = B + A

The transpose is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication, as expressed by $(cA)^{T} = c(A^{T})$ and $(A + B)^{T} = A^{T} + B^{T}$.


Finally, $(A^{T})^{T} = A$.
