# Build your first system quickly, then iterate

There are specific techniques for making speech recognition systems more robust.

- Noisy background
  - Bar/caf√© noise.
  - Car noise.
- Accented speech
- Far from microphone
- Young children's speech
- Stuttering (uh,ah,um...)
- ...

## Guideline

1. Set up dev/test set and metric
2. Build initial system quickly
3. Use Bias/Variance analysis & Error analysis to prioritize next steps.
