# Why look at case studies?

Even if you end up not working computer vision yourself, I think you find a lot of the ideas from some of these examples.

Classic networks:

- LeNet-5: 1980s
- AlexNet
- VGG network

And some of the ideas lay the foundation for modern computer vision. And you see ideas in these papers that are probably useful for your own.

- ResNet (trained a very, very deep 152-layer neural network).
- Inception neural network.
