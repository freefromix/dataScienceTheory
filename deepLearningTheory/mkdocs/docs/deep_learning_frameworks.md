## Choosing deep learning frameworks

Choosing deep learning frameworks:
  - Ease of programming (development and deployment
  - Running speed
  - Truly open (open source with good governance)

----

**Truly open**

Unfortunately, some companies have a history of open sourcing software but maintaining single corporation control of the software.

And then over some number of years, as people start to use the software, some companies have a history of gradually closing off what was open source, or perhaps moving functionality into their own proprietary cloud services.

How much you trust that the framework will remain open source for a long time rather than just being under the control of a single company  which for whatever reason may choose to close it off in the future even if the software is currently released under open source.
