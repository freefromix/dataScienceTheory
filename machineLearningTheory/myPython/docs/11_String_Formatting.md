## String Formatting

### % operator

```python
name = 'Pete'
'Hello %s' % name
```

We can use the `%x` format specifier to convert an int value to a string:

```python
num = 5
'I have %x apples' % num
```

Note: For new code, using str.format or f-strings is strongly recommended over the `%` operator.

### str.format

Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting that was later back-ported to Python 2.7. This makes the syntax for string formatting more regular.

```python
name = 'John'
age = 20'

"Hello I'm {}, my age is {}".format(name, age)
```

```python
"Hello I'm {0}, my age is {1}".format(name, age)
```

The official [Python 3.x documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=sprintf#printf-style-string-formatting) recommend `str.format` over the `%` operator:

> The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals or the str.format() interface helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.

### Lazy string formatting

You would only use `%s` string formatting on functions that can do lazy parameters evaluation,
the most common being logging:

Prefer:

```python
name = "alice"
logging.debug("User name: %s", name)
```

Over:

```python
logging.debug("User name: {}".format(name))
```

Or:

```python
logging.debug("User name: " + name)
```

### Formatted String Literals or f-strings

Python 3.6+

```python
name = 'Elizabeth'
f'Hello {name}!'
```

It is even possible to do inline arithmetic with it:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'
```

### Template Strings

A simpler and less powerful mechanism, but it is recommended when handling format strings generated by users. Due to their reduced complexity template strings are a safer choice.

```python
from string import Template

name = 'Elizabeth'
t = Template('Hey $name!')
t.substitute(name=name)
```
