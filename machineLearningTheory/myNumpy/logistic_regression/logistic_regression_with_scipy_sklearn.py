    # Mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction and one wants
    # to estimate howaccurately a model will perform in practice.
    # The goal of cross-validation is to define a data set to test the model in
    # the training phase (i.e. validation data set) in order to limit problems
    # like overfitting, and get an insight on how the model will generalize
    # to an independent data set.
    # LogisticRegressionCV: The default cross-validation generator used is Stratified K-Folds
    # cv: If an integer is provided, then it is the number of folds used.
    # Changed in version 0.20: cv default value if None will change from 3-fold to 5-fold in v0.22.
